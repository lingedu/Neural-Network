# Deep Learning Practice

In this repository, I practice some basic deep learnging models to predict the hand-written digits. I implement multi-Layer neural network by scratch with Numpy. I also practice to implement the neural network by Pytorch and Karas. Besides of multi-Layer model, I also using convolutionary neraul network (CNN, which is a popular skills in image classification) to make prediction.

MNIST is a popular hand-written digits database which are often taken as a good practice subject for beginners in deep leanrning. MINST data set: https://github.com/hsjeong5/MNIST-for-Numpy.
