    "In this repository, I practice some basic deep learnging models to predict the hand-written digits. I implement multi-Layer neural network by scratch with Numpy. I also practice to implement the neural network by Pytorch and Karas. Besides of multi-Layer model, I also using convolutionary neraul network (CNN, which is a popular skills in image classification) to make prediction.\n",
